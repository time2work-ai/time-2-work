## User perspective scenarios
### 1. Employee Scenarios

  As an Employee, I want to...

   * ...log in to the system securely to access my personal dashboard.
       * Scenario: I enter my email and password on the login page. The system verifies my credentials and
         role, then directs me to my employee dashboard.

   * ...view my personal dashboard to get a quick overview of my status.
       * Scenario: Upon logging in, I see a calendar view of my logged hours for the current month, my current
          holiday balance (total, used, remaining), and any pending holiday requests.

   * ...log my daily working hours accurately and easily.
       * Scenario 1 (Standard Day): I enter my start time (e.g., 9:05), end time (e.g., 17:15), and break
         duration (e.g., 0.5 hours). The system automatically calculates my total hours (8.0) and overtime
         (0.0) and confirms my entry is compliant with the 11-hour rest period.
       * Scenario 2 (Overtime): I enter a start and end time that exceeds 8 hours (e.g., 9:00 to 19:00 with a
         1-hour break). The system logs 8 hours as standard work and 2 hours as overtime, flagging it for
         manager review.
       * Scenario 3 (Compliance Violation): I try to log hours that violate the 11-hour rest rule (e.g.,
         finishing at 23:00 and starting at 7:00 the next day). The AI Copilot flags this, explains the
         violation, and suggests I adjust the times to be compliant before saving.

   * ...request time off for holidays.
       * Scenario 1 (Annual Leave): I select "Annual Leave," choose a date range (e.g., July 10-15), and
         submit the request. The system checks my remaining holiday balance. If sufficient, the request is
         sent to my manager for approval.
       * Scenario 2 (Leave on Demand - "Na Żądanie"): I need to take tomorrow off unexpectedly. I select
         "Leave on Demand," choose the date, and submit. The system checks if I have used fewer than 4 "na
         żądanie" days this year and, if so, sends it for approval.
       * Scenario 3 (Insufficient Balance): I try to request 10 days of annual leave when I only have 5 days
         remaining. The system informs me of the insufficient balance and prevents the request.

   * ...receive notifications about my holiday requests.
       * Scenario: After my manager approves my leave request, I receive an email notification and see the
         updated status on my dashboard. The approved days are marked in my calendar.

   * ...use the AI Holiday Planner to find the best time for a vacation.
       * Scenario: I ask the AI Copilot: "Find the best two weeks for a family holiday in August." The AI
         analyzes my team's calendar for coverage, project deadlines, and even external data like school
         holiday schedules or flight prices, then suggests 2-3 optimal date ranges and helps me auto-assign a
         backup.

   * ...interact with the system via a chatbot (e.g., Slack).
       * Scenario 1: I type /loghours 9:00-17:30 into a Slack channel. The chatbot confirms my hours have been
          logged.
       * Scenario 2: I type /request holiday October 5-10. The chatbot confirms the request has been submitted
          to my manager.

### 1b. Additional Employee Scenarios

   * ...correct a previously logged time entry.
       * Scenario: I realize I made a mistake on yesterday's time entry. I go to my timesheet, find the entry,
          and click "Edit." I correct the times and add a reason for the change (e.g., "Forgot to log a
         break"). The updated entry is either saved directly or sent to my manager for approval, depending on
         company policy.

   * ...log time for a partial day of work combined with partial leave.
       * Scenario: I have a doctor's appointment and have taken a half-day of annual leave. I work from 9:00
         to 13:00. I log these 4 hours as work time. The system shows that the other 4 hours of the workday
         are covered by my approved leave request.

   * ...view my historical holiday requests and their statuses.
       * Scenario: I want to check why a leave request was rejected last year. I navigate to a "History" tab
         on my dashboard where I can see all my past requests, who approved/rejected them, and on what date.

   * ...handle a "na żądanie" request on the same day.
       * Scenario: I wake up feeling unwell. At 8:30 AM, I log into the mobile app or use the Slack bot to
         request "Leave on Demand" for today. The system immediately notifies my manager of the urgent
         request.

   * ...see my holiday entitlement change mid-year.
       * Scenario: My 10th anniversary with the company is in June. According to Polish law, my holiday
         entitlement increases from 20 to 26 days. On the date of my anniversary, the system automatically
         updates my total entitlement for the year, pro-rating the additional days for the remainder of the
         year.

### 2. Manager Scenarios

  As a Manager, I want to...

   * ...view a dashboard summarizing my team's status to manage them effectively.
       * Scenario: I log in and see a list of pending holiday requests, a team calendar showing who is off and
          when, and a list of recent compliance alerts (e.g., employees exceeding 40 hours/week).

   * ...approve or reject holiday requests from my team members.
       * Scenario: I receive a notification for a new holiday request. I review the request, check the team
         calendar for coverage, and see the AI's suggestion for a backup. I click "Approve." The system
         automatically deducts the days from the employee's entitlement, notifies the employee, and updates
         the team calendar.

   * ...receive and handle compliance alerts.
       * Scenario 1 (Weekly Overtime): An employee on my team logs 45 hours in a week. I receive an alert. I
         can then talk to the employee to decide whether to approve it as paid overtime or have them bank the
         hours.
       * Scenario 2 (Rest Period Violation): An employee logs hours violating the 11-hour rest period. The
         system alerts me. I can see the AI's suggested correction and can override or discuss it with the
         employee.

   * ...assign or change a backup for an employee who is on leave.
       * Scenario: When approving a holiday request, the system suggests a backup based on team roles and
         availability. I can accept the suggestion or manually select a different team member from a dropdown
         list.

   * ...view my team's time records to monitor workload and productivity.
       * Scenario: I navigate to the "Team View" and can see a table of all time entries for my team members
         for a selected period, including regular hours, overtime, and breaks.

### 2b. Additional Manager Scenarios

   * ...delegate approval authority while I am on vacation.
       * Scenario: I am going on leave for two weeks. In the system, I designate another manager (or a senior
         team member) as my temporary delegate. All approval requests sent to me during my vacation are
         automatically rerouted to my delegate.

   * ...handle overlapping holiday requests from multiple team members.
       * Scenario: Two key team members request the same week off. The system flags this as a "coverage risk."
          When I review the requests, the AI Copilot suggests approving the first request and proposing an
         alternative date for the second, ensuring the team remains functional.

   * ...view a compliance "hotspot" report for my team.
       * Scenario: I want to proactively address compliance issues. I run a report that shows which employees
         on my team most frequently violate the 11-hour rest rule or work excessive overtime. This allows me
         to address the issue with the individuals before it becomes a systemic problem.

   * ...handle a time entry that requires manual correction.
       * Scenario: An employee logs 16 hours for a single day by mistake. The system flags this as an anomaly.
          I can directly edit the entry down to the correct 8 hours and add a comment, or I can reject the
         entry and send it back to the employee with a note asking them to correct it.

  ### 3. Admin Scenarios

  As an Admin, I want to...

   * ...register a new employee in the system.
       * Scenario: I go to the "Admin Panel," click "Add Employee," and fill in their details (name, email,
         role, manager, contract type, seniority). The system automatically calculates their holiday
         entitlement (20 or 26 days) based on Polish law and their seniority.

   * ...manage user roles and permissions.
       * Scenario: An employee is promoted to a manager role. I find the user, change their role from
         "Employee" to "Manager," and the system automatically grants them access to the manager dashboard and
          functionalities.

   * ...generate compliance reports for government audits (e.g., PIP).
       * Scenario: I need to prepare for an audit. I go to the "Reports" section, select the "PIP-Compliant
         Report" for a specific date range. The system generates a "clean" report showing only official,
         compliant working hours (e.g., 8 hours/day), excluding any "grey zone" flexibility like banked
         overtime. The report is exportable as a CSV or PDF.

   * ...generate internal reports for business analysis.
       * Scenario: I want to analyze overtime across the company. I select the "Internal Overtime Report." The
          system generates a detailed report showing all logged hours, including banked overtime and flexible
         arrangements, which helps in resource planning and cost analysis.

   * ...configure the "Grey Zone" mode for the entire organization.
       * Scenario: The company decides to operate under a strict compliance model. I go to the system settings
          and set the "Grey Zone" toggle to "Strict." This disables features like overtime banking and
         enforces all labor law rules without exception.

   * ...manage system-wide settings and automations.
       * Scenario: I can configure the automated reminder that goes out to all employees in September about
         using their remaining holiday entitlement before the deadline.

   * ...manage i18n (internationalization) settings.
       * Scenario: I can add or edit the JSON translation files to update wording for either the Polish or
         English interface.


### 3b. Additional Admin Scenarios

   * ...handle the termination of an employee.
       * Scenario: An employee leaves the company. I mark their profile as "Inactive." The system archives
         their data, revokes their access, and ensures their final timesheets and holiday balances are
         correctly calculated for their final payroll. Their data is retained for the legally required period
         for audit purposes.

   * ...perform a bulk import of users during initial setup.
       * Scenario: The company is adopting the app for the first time. Instead of adding 300 employees
         manually, I use a CSV template to upload all user data at once, including their names, managers,
         contract details, and historical seniority.

   * ...manage public holidays.
       * Scenario: The system is pre-configured with Polish public holidays. However, the company decides to
         grant an extra day off for Christmas Eve. I can go into the system settings and add December 24th as
         a company-wide "bank holiday," which will automatically be excluded from work time calculations.

   * ...run an audit log report to track critical system events.
       * Scenario: A dispute arises over a changed time entry. I can run a detailed audit log report that
         shows who created the entry, who modified it, when it was modified, and from what IP address. This
         provides a clear, immutable record of all actions taken within the system.

   * ...customize notification templates.
       * Scenario: The default email notifications are too generic. I go to the settings and edit the
         templates for "Holiday Approved" or "Compliance Alert" to include company-specific language or links
         to internal policies.

  ### These scenarios add another layer of detail and account for the more complex, real-world situations that a
   comprehensive time management system needs to handle.
