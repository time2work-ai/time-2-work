## The Core 20% of Scenarios for an 80% Workflow

###  1. Employee: The "Daily Log & Request" Loop

  This is the most frequent interaction an employee will have with the system.

   * Scenario E-1: Log a Standard Workday.
       * Action: The employee logs in, opens a simple time entry form, inputs their start time, end time, and
         break duration.
       * System Check (Critical): The system automatically calculates the total hours and validates the entry
         against the 11-hour rest period rule.
       * Why it's Core: This is the fundamental data-entry action for the entire application. It needs to be
         fast, simple, and reliable.

   * Scenario E-2: View Personal Holiday Balance.
       * Action: The employee looks at their dashboard to see their remaining holiday days.
       * System Check (Critical): The balance must be clearly displayed and accurate.
       * Why it's Core: This is the primary driver for leave planning and a key piece of information for
         employee satisfaction.

   * Scenario E-3: Request Annual Leave.
       * Action: The employee selects "Annual Leave," chooses a start and end date from a calendar, and
         submits the request.
       * System Check (Critical): The system must verify that the requested duration does not exceed the
         available balance.
       * Why it's Core: This is the second most common employee action and is essential for workforce
         management.

###  2. Manager: The "Approve & Monitor" Loop

  This covers the manager's primary responsibilities in the system.

   * Scenario M-1: Approve or Reject a Leave Request.
       * Action: The manager receives a notification, reviews a pending leave request, and clicks "Approve" or
          "Reject."
       * System Check (Critical): Upon approval, the system must automatically deduct the days from the
         employee's entitlement and update the team calendar. A backup should be suggested.
       * Why it's Core: This is the critical link in the leave management workflow. Without it, the process
         stalls.

   * Scenario M-2: View the Team Calendar.
       * Action: The manager checks a simple calendar view to see which team members are on leave during a
         specific week or month.
       * System Check (Critical): The calendar must be accurate and easy to read.
       * Why it's Core: This is essential for planning, resource allocation, and making informed decisions on
         leave approvals.

   * Scenario M-3: Receive a Core Compliance Alert.
       * Action: The manager is notified when an employee logs hours that violate a critical rule (e.g.,
         working more than an average of 48 hours over the reporting period, or a clear violation of the
         11-hour rest rule).
       * System Check (Critical): The alert must be clear, timely, and provide context.
       * Why it's Core: This is the foundational feature of the "compliance" aspect of the app and protects
         the company from legal risk.

###  3. Admin: The "Onboard & Report" Loop

  This covers the admin's foundational and highest-impact responsibilities.

   * Scenario A-1: Register a New Employee.
       * Action: The admin creates a new user profile, assigning their role, manager, and contract type.
       * System Check (Critical): The system must automatically calculate and assign the correct holiday
         entitlement (20 or 26 days) based on the provided data.
       * Why it's Core: The entire workflow for any given user starts here. This process must be seamless.

   * Scenario A-2: Generate a PIP-Compliant Report.
       * Action: The admin selects a date range and generates a clean, official report of employee work hours
         suitable for a government audit.
       * System Check (Critical): The report must accurately reflect a compliant 8-hour workday, excluding any
          flexible or "grey zone" arrangements. It must be exportable (e.g., to CSV).
       * Why it's Core: This is the ultimate deliverable for the compliance promise of the application and a
         major selling point.

### By focusing development on these eight scenarios, we will build a fully functional, end-to-end workflow that covers the most critical needs of every user role. This provides a strong foundation to which we can later add the more nuanced features like the AI Copilot, i18n, and detailed internal reporting.
