 ## The Essential Application Workflow

  The entire lifecycle of an employee's time and attendance is handled in a simple, automated, and compliant
   flow.

###  1. It Starts with a Smart Setup
  The process begins when an administrator onboards a new employee. Time2Work instantly analyzes their work
  history and education to automatically assign the correct annual leave entitlementâ€”20 or 26 days. This
  eliminates manual calculation and ensures the foundational element of their employment is legally
  compliant from day one.

###  2. Daily Work is Captured Intelligently
  An employee simply tracks their hours. If they work late, Time2Work automatically detects the extra time,
  calculates the overtime, and applies the correct 150% or 200% pay supplement. There is no need for manual
  timesheet adjustments or complex calculations; the system handles it correctly every time.

###  3. Requesting Time Off is Simple
  When an employee needs time off, they request vacation directly in the app. The system checks their
  available balance and sends the request to their manager for a simple, one-click approval. This
  streamlines a common HR process for both employees and managers.

###  4. The System Acts as an Intelligent Guardian
  Time2Work doesn't just record data; it actively protects the business. If a manager attempts to create a
  schedule that violates the mandatory 11-hour rest period between shifts, the system will actively block
  the action and explain the compliance issue, preventing costly legal mistakes before they can happen.

###  5. Everything Leads to Being Instantly Audit-Ready
  Ultimately, all of this meticulous, automated record-keeping culminates in one powerful feature: the
  one-click PIP Audit Report. At any moment, an administrator can generate a perfectly formatted, legally
  compliant report that proves adherence to labor laws, providing complete peace of mind and readiness for
  any government inspection.
