###  For Administrators & HR: Powerful Management, Automated Compliance

  For managers and HR professionals, Time2Work is a robust command center that automates the most challenging
   aspects of Polish labor law.

   * The Compliance Engine: At its core, Time2Work contains a powerful rules engine that understands the
     nuances of the Polish Labor Code. It automatically validates schedules against mandatory rest periods,
     flags potential overtime limit breaches, and ensures all leave is calculated correctly.
   * Dynamic Employee Profiles: The system is built on the principle that every employee is unique. When you
     create a profile, Time2Work adapts automatically.
       * Hiring? It calculates the correct annual leave (20 or 26 days) based on education and work tenure.
       * Part-time worker? All limits and entitlements are adjusted proportionally.
       * Special Status? For pregnant employees, disabled individuals, or workers under 18, the system
         automatically applies the legally required protections, such as blocking overtime and night work and
         adjusting work norms.
   * Total Flexibility for Work Systems: Configure employees for any of the 8 different work systems defined
     by law—from a standard 8-hour day (podstawowy) to flexible (ruchomy) or task-based (zadaniowy) schedules.
      The system automatically applies the correct rules for calculating work hours and overtime for each one.
   * Audit-Ready, Instantly: Generate a complete, compliant report for a National Labor Inspectorate (PIP)
     audit with a single click. The report includes a full history of work hours, overtime, leave, and proof
     of respected rest periods, ensuring you are always prepared.
   * Full Lifecycle Management: Time2Work handles everything from onboarding a first-time employee (with
     prorated leave) to offboarding a veteran, where it automatically calculates the final monetary equivalent
      (ekwiwalent) for any unused vacation days.

 ### For Developers: A Robust and Reliable Foundation

  Time2Work is built on modern architectural principles to ensure data integrity, reliability, and a complete
  audit trail for every action taken within the system.

   * Compliance as Code: The complex rules of the Polish Labor Code are not just guidelines; they are embedded
      into the application's core logic. All calculations for leave, overtime, rest periods, and special
     supplements are automated and precise.
   * Event-Sourced Integrity: Every action—from a clock-in to a timesheet correction—is recorded as an
     immutable event. This provides a perfect, chronological audit trail and allows for accurate historical
     corrections without compromising data integrity.
   * Modular Design: The system is designed to handle the distinct logic for each of the 8 work systems and
     various contract types (Umowa o pracę, zlecenie, etc.) in isolated, testable modules, ensuring accuracy
     and reliability.
