## Time Evidency App: High-Level Context

  This application is designed to be a comprehensive and flexible solution for time tracking and compliance
  management, specifically tailored to the nuances of Polish labor law. It aims to serve organizations of
  all sizes by providing clear, role-based interfaces for employees, managers, and administrators.

  The core of the system is built around a robust backend, powered by Python (FastAPI), which handles all
  business logic, from time entry validation to compliance checks. A PostgreSQL database serves as the
  single source of truth for all data, including user profiles, time logs, holiday requests, and compliance
  events.

  The frontend is a modern, responsive React application that provides an intuitive user experience. Each
  user role (Employee, Manager, Admin) has a dedicated dashboard with the specific tools and information
  they need to perform their tasks efficiently.

  A key feature of the application is its "Grey Zone" flexibility, which allows organizations to choose
  between strict enforcement of labor laws and a more flexible approach that accommodates overtime banking
  and other common practices. This is reflected in a dual-layer reporting system that can generate both
  internal (flexible) and government-compliant (strict) reports.

  To further enhance the user experience and streamline compliance, the application integrates an AI-powered
   "Compliance Copilot" using the Gemini API. This assistant helps users identify and correct potential
  compliance violations in real-time, and it can also assist with holiday planning by suggesting optimal
  leave slots based on team availability and other factors.

  The application is designed to be modular and scalable, with a clear separation of concerns between the
  frontend, backend, and database. This architecture allows for future expansion and integration with other
  systems, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams for chatbot-based interactions.

  In essence, the Time Evidency App is more than just a time tracking tool; it's a comprehensive platform
  for managing workforce time, ensuring compliance, and empowering organizations with the flexibility they
  need to thrive.
